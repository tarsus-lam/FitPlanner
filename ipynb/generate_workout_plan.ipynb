Crossover exercises are intended to isolate the pecs from different angles.\\n\\nDay 2 (Lower Body): \\n    Exercise 1: Weighted Jump Squat\\n    Exercise 2: Barbell front squat\\n    Exercise 3: Machine Squat\\n    Exercise 4: Narrow-stance leg press\\n    Rationale: Concentrated on legs, including quadriceps and hamstrings. Squat variations develop power and strength while the leg press assists in isolating muscles and providing shape.\\n\\nDay 3 (Upper Body):\\n    Exercise 1: Butterfly\\n    Exercise 2: Machine chest press\\n    Exercise 3: Smith machine bench press\\n    Exercise 4: Leverage Chest Press\\n    Rationale: Continuation Day 1 with a different set of exercises for variety and muscle confusion.\\n\\nDay 4 (Lower body):\\n    Exercise 1: Smith machine box squat\\n    Exercise 2: Smith machine back squat\\n    Exercise 3: Calf Press On The Leg Press Machine\\n    Exercise 4: Seated Calf Raise\\n    Rationale: Lower body workout focusing more on the posterior chain with emphasis on the glutes and calf muscles.\\n\\nDay 5 (Upper Body):\\n    Exercise 1: Chest dip\\n    Exercise 2: Low-cable cross-over\\n    Exercise 3: Single-arm cable cross-over\\n    Exercise 4: Cable Crossover\\n    Rationale: Repetition of certain exercises from Day 1 & 3 for focus on pecs and to enhance intensity over time.\\n\\nDay 6 (Lower body):\\n    Exercise 1: Weighted Jump Squat \\n    Exercise 2: Machine Squat\\n    Exercise 3: Smith machine leg press \\n    Exercise 4: Lying Machine Squat\\n    Rationale: Repetition of selected exercises for Day 2 & 4 to reinforce the emphasis on lower body strength and power.\\n\\nDay 7: Rest Day\\n    Rationale: Rest is vital for muscle recovery and growth.
